- Should the content be translated / translatable?
- Connect the diverse Scribus communities out there
  - Social Media
    - Google+
    - Twitter
    - Reddit
  - By Country
    - Italy
    - France
    - who else?
  - Other F/OSS efforts out there
    - [GIMP](http://wwww.gimp.org)
    - [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org)
    - [Krita](www.krita.org)

- As a reference, this is [the mission for the Blender website](http://www.blender.org/news/blender-2013-website-launch/):
  > Blender is widely regarded as a mature and high quality tool.  A surprisingly successful open source project that can compete with the best commercial 3D tools out there. This means our website message can change to reflect that. Instead of explaining how awesome Blender undoubtedly is we now should communicate more whoâ€™s actually using Blender and what they do with it.

  > To summarize, the three key questions this site should answer and clearly communicate:

  > - What is Blender, where can I get it and how to use it?
  > - Who is making Blender and how can I get involved?
  > - Who uses Blender, what do they do with it?
